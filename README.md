# Markov-chain-simulation
This is a markov chain simulation use for a maintenance optimization project for 20 wind turbines.
This code is intended to be used as a tool and to be modified to the specific userâ€™s needs and for this purpose it allows for great malleability for variables such as costs, simulation times, profits, and schedules.
